Search Garden Plots by Name or Location: Implement an endpoint that allows users to search for garden plots based on their names or locations. Users can input a search term, and the backend can perform a partial match search in the database and return relevant results.

Generate Gardening Tips: Create an endpoint that generates random gardening tips or advice for users. These tips can be sourced from a predefined list or generated based on specific criteria.

Calculate Garden Plot Statistics: Develop an operation that calculates statistics for a specific garden plot, such as the total area, number of plants, average plant growth, etc. This can provide useful insights to gardeners.

Recommend Plants: Implement a feature that recommends suitable plants for a given garden plot based on its location, soil type, climate, and user preferences.

Task Reminders: Set up a scheduled task that sends reminders to users about pending tasks in their garden plots. This could be done using background jobs or cron jobs.

Advanced Sorting and Filtering: Enhance the sorting and filtering options for garden plots. Allow users to sort by various criteria (e.g., plant types, creation date) and provide advanced filtering options.

Collaborative Annotations: Enable users to add annotations or comments to specific garden plots or tasks. This can foster collaboration among gardeners.

Weather Alerts: Implement a feature that sends weather alerts or warnings to users if adverse weather conditions are expected in their location.

User Notifications: Develop a system for sending notifications to users about updates, announcements, or changes related to their garden plots or collaborative activities.

User Activity Logs: Keep track of user activities, such as when a task was completed, a new plant was added, or an annotation was made. This can be useful for tracking and accountability.
